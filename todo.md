## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
We opted for a simpler approach by keeping the existing HTML/CSS/JS structure rather than migrating to Next.js and TypeScript. This allowed us to:
- Focus on content and visual changes rather than rebuilding the architecture
- Preserve the existing GSAP animations that were already working well
- Reduce complexity and development time
- Lower the risk of introducing new bugs or performance issues

### Key Modifications
1. **Content Updates**: Replaced all text content with Pineapple's copy while maintaining the scroll-based narrative structure.
2. **Visual Styling**: Updated colors to a warmer palette that aligns with Pineapple's brand identity.
3. **Accessibility**: Added skip links, ARIA attributes, and reduced motion support.
4. **Voice Input**: Added a supplementary voice command feature as specified in the PRD.

### Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices
2. Implement the contact form functionality
3. Further optimize images and performance
4. Enhance accessibility with more comprehensive testing
5. Consider implementing additional microinteractions as specified in the PRD

## Future Considerations
If a more comprehensive rebuild is desired in the future, the following could be considered:
- Migration to Next.js for improved SEO and performance
- Implementation of Tailwind CSS for more consistent styling
- Component-based architecture with React
- More advanced animations and interactions
- Integration with a CMS for easier content management
